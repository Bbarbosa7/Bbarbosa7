## Public information ðŸ’¡

I am a software engineer with a strong focus on building REST APIs. My expertise revolves around using PHP with pure object-oriented programming, often employing architectural patterns like Hexagonal, CQRS, or utilizing frameworks such as Laravel. Additionally, I have extensive experience in designing and constructing microservices in Go, following Event-Driven Architecture and REST principles while adhering to best development practices.

My development philosophy emphasizes Test-Driven Development (TDD) and the implementation of design patterns. I am also well-versed in application monitoring, utilizing tools like DataDog and GrayLog. Moreover, I possess a deep understanding of Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines, with proficiency in Jenkins.

On the database side, I work extensively with MySQL and DynamoDB. I have a comprehensive grasp of the entire AWS stack and frequently use Git, Docker, and Linux in my work. While my current role primarily involves backend development, I also have a strong background in frontend technologies, particularly VueJS, although I am not currently utilizing these skills in my current position.
